This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python. The player competes against the computer, with the player using the "X" symbol and the computer using the "O" symbol.

**Game Rules**
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
The player selects a position (1-9) on the grid to place their "X".
The computer randomly selects a position to place its "O".
The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all positions are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
